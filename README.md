# Requirements
The Requirements for this project are:

* xclip
* xautomation
* X11
* Xinerama
* Xft

> sudo apt-get install -y xclip xautomation libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev


# Installation

Clone the repository into /opt directory:

> sudo git clone https://github.com/Cipher7/dmenu_pentest.git

Then go inside the directory **dmenu-4.9** and run :

> sudo chmod +x install.sh

> sudo ./install.sh

The install.sh will apply the necessary patches followd by making a clean install of the custom dmenu.

After the installation in complete. Assign a shortcut to the dmenu_pentest script by going to the keyboard settings in your linux machine and adding the shortcut. I have chosen the Ctrl+D shortcut forinvoking the script but you can make it whatever you want.

In the keyboard shortcuts just add:

> bash /opt/dmenu_pentest/dmenu_pentest.sh

And then assign a shotcut to it!

Now you should be able to call the script with just the shortcut!

# Usage

The Menu now can be accessed using just the shortcut you created in the installation phase and arrow keys to move around and the enter key to select an options.
